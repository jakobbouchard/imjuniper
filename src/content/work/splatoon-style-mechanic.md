## Project overview

In my second semester at UQAT, I was part of a team of 8 people, including 3 artists, 4 designers, and myself as the main developer/tech designer. We had to randomly draw a pop culture character and create a game inspired by it. We got Splatoon's Inkling, and took the bold decision to replicate the ink mechanic as our main game mechanic, which ended up being quite the technical challenge.

## My role

I was in charge of developing the ink mechanic, debugging and fixing performance issues, as well as helping my team with developing the other features.

Here it is in action in a testing gym, followed by a little bit of gameplay from our completed project.
