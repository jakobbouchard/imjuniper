## My role

This project was for RCGT Consulting and the Government of Canada, which presented the constraint of not utilizing a server. Drawing from my personal experience with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), I made the decision to adopt [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) as a static site generator. This choice proved advantageous as it provided the necessary functionality while ensuring compatibility across various web browsers, including Internet Explorer. As a result, the exported project used static files, meeting the client's requirements and delivering a robust solution. I want to note that [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) was not an option at the time, as it was not production-ready and didn't support IE (and still doesn't).
