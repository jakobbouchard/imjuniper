## Project overview

Guano is a navigation game published on Steam created by a [team of 27 students](https://guanothegame.com/credits.html). In this game, the player embodies a seagull that must steal food from humans by any means, whether by defecating or screaming, and complete quests to reclaim the island. The game was built using Unreal Engine 5.2.1 over the course of two university semesters at UQAT. It was one of two final projects, the other one being Bolt'N'Punch, that you can [check out on Steam too](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779390/BoltNPunch/).

## My role

I have been part of Guano from the beginning of the project in September 2023 right up until the release in March 2024. My role shifted from being the technical lead during the project's conception to being more of a jack-of-all-trades on the technical side, while still helping the technical director on some decisions.

### Project conception

The class was

### Technical demo

### First playable product

### Release

From January to March, we started working on everything that would be needed for the release of the game. One of the necessary feature for the release of the game was Steam integration, which was something I wanted to do.
