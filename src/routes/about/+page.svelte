				<figcaption>Hey! That’s me!</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Hello there 👋 I am Jakob Bouchard, and uh, this is my website!</p>
			<p>
				I completed a college degree in <a

					href="https://cegepoutaouais.qc.ca/programmes/programmes-techniques/arts-et-communications-graphiques/integration-multimedia/"
					target="_blank">Multimedia Integration</a
				>
				at the Cégep de l’Outaouais, and I am currently studying in video game development at
				<a href="https://uqat.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UQAT</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I work at <a href="https://prosomo.com">Prosomo</a> as a web developer, and previously worked
				at Best Buy as a Geek Squad agent.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I’m not studying or working, I’m usually chilling at home with my girlfriend, our 3
				cats 🐱 and our dog 🐶.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to see the hardware and software I use, I have a <a href="/uses">uses page</a> just
				for that!
			</p>
			<h2 id="what-i-do-other-than-tech-stuff">What I do, other than tech stuff</h2>
			<p>
				If I’m not working or at school, I usually watch videos on YouTube, listen to music, or play
				video games. My top channels currently are <a
					href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TechnologyConnections"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer noopener">Technology Connections</a
				>,
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TomScottGo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
					>Tom Scott</a
				>
				and
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Miziziziz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
					>Miziziziz</a
				>, though I watch a bunch of other people too.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the music side, in no particular order, I’ve been listening to <a

				I’m currently going through the whole Assassin’s Creed series, Watch Dogs Legion, and Read
				Dead Redemption 2 for the second time.

			<h2 id="my-little-family">My little family</h2>
			<p>I previously said that I had 3 cats and a dog, so here they are!</p>
			<p>
				This is Linux, though we literally always call her Lily. We adopted her when I graduated
				from college, a bit of a gift to myself let’s say! She’s my little baby, but she can get
				really annoying in the morning, or when she jumps on the table to eat our food. She’s 2
				years old now.

				Here is Mew, my girlfriend’s 5 year old cat. She adopted her when she got out of high school
				and to say she’s the most precious thing she has would be an understatement. She’s our big
				girl and she basically always sleep.

				This little boy is Neko, our youngest, when he was only 2 months old, though he is now a bit
				over a year old. We got him when he was 2 days old from the local SPCA when my girlfriend
				worked there a couple of weeks ago, since he was gonna get put down due to lack of
				resources. We were supposed to only foster him, but we obviously fell in love with him, so
				we decided to keep him! He’s a fighter and a keeper.

				This fluffy guy is Flocon, our super hyperactive dog! He always wants to lick us and hang
				with us. He’s always happy and his fluffiness makes the world around him brighter and
				happier. He can get a little anxious sometimes when he’s alone, but he gets along with Neko,
				so at least he has a friend 😄
